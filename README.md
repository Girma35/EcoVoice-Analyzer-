## üéØ **Hackathon Challenge: Environment & Sustainability + Inclusion & Equity**

### **Problem Statement**
Environmental pollution disproportionately affects marginalized communities who often lack the resources, technical knowledge, or platforms to effectively report incidents. Traditional reporting systems require:
- Complex forms and technical terminology
- Internet access and digital literacy
- Knowledge of appropriate government agencies
- Understanding of pollution classification

**Result**: Critical environmental incidents go unreported, perpetuating environmental injustice.

### **Our AI Solution**
EcoVoice Analyzer democratizes environmental reporting by transforming voice recordings into comprehensive incident reports using multiple AI technologies:

1. **Speech Recognition AI**: Converts voice recordings to text in multiple languages
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Extracts location data and incident details from conversational speech
3. **Environmental Classification AI**: Uses Cohere's LLM to classify pollution types and assess severity
4. **Intelligent Recommendation Engine**: Generates cleanup strategies and identifies responsible agencies
5. **Geospatial AI**: Automatically geocodes locations from natural language descriptions
